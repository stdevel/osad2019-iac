# Deploy a new Linux machine from template

This terraform configuration deploys a new Linux machine from a template (*the one we built with [Packer](../packer/)*).

# Prerequisites
Ensure to have the following requirements fulfilled:
- [Terraform](https://terraform.io) is installed
- VMware vCenter Server
  - vSphere cluster with at least one host
  - at least one datastore and network

# Preparation
Create a file containing user credentials used for VM provisioning:

```
$ cat credentials-simone.tfvars
vsphere_user = "giertz.loc\\simone"
vsphere_password = "pinkepank"
```

# Example

To start, copy the [`demo_vm.tfvars`](demo_vm.tfvars) file and alter it to match the new VM.

The example file looks like this:
```
vm_hostname = "myvm"
user_network_ip = "10.0.0.10"
user_network_gateway = "10.0.0.1"
```

This will deploy a new VM named **myvm** with user network IP address **10.0.0.10** and gateway **10.0.0.1**.

Before deployment, make sure that your Terraform configuration is valid (``validate``). After that, see which changes would be made (``plan``) before actually executing them (``apply``):
```
$ terraform validate -var-file=credentials-simone.tfvars -var-file=demo_vm.tfvars
$ terraform plan -var-file=credentials-simone.tfvars -var-file=demo_vm.tfvars
$ terraform apply -var-file=credentials-simone.tfvars -var-file=demo_vm.tfvars
```

To destroy your VM, run the ``destroy`` subcommand:
```
$ terraform destroy -var-file=credentials-simone.tfvars -var-file=demo_vm.tfvars
```
